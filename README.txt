Publish posts with future dates immediately.

== Description ==

Sometimes you want to add a post, give it a future date. WordPress by default will schedule the post and automatically publish it on that future date. However sometimes you want posts with future dates to be published immediately.

For example, the post might be about an upcoming event and the post's date should be the date of the event. This plugin allows you to do just that. It eliminates all post scheduling and publishes posts immediately.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `publish-future-posts-now` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I activated the plugin and nothing happened. Is it broken? =

No it is not broken. The purpose of the plugin is to immediately publish posts with future dates. If you create a new post, give it a publish date in the future and click 'Schedule' the posts will be published.

= Is there supposed to be an options page? I don't see one =

At this point there is no need for an options page. As soon as you activate the plugin you can start publishing posts with future dates. No other setup is required.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
